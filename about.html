				<h4>The Web:</h4>
				<hr>
				<p>I couldn't draw since I was a child. Aside from a couple of mountains, the sun, a wavy stream and an abnormal house, I could barely draw anything great. So following 2 years of drawing lessons and 6 years of science diagrams(completed by my sister) unmistakably I wasn't the imaginative one in my family and that I ought to stick to riddles and math. I had two or three spells with making websites since I was in school, yet it wasn't up to this point I found my adoration for it! I, at last, found what I cherish doing and thinking back on my life, everything bodes well at this point. I began *studying* web development when I turned into the webmaster for a student association at UF. Before long, I understood that I have been imaginative all my life-dependably the one to make up stories, develop new recipes, make simple household things, write fan-fictions, create wall decor for my dorm and that's only the tip of the iceberg. I am in it for the whole deal!</p>

				<h4>The Weird:</h4>
				<hr>
				<p> I cherish a wide arrangement of things. Since youth, I have obtained a lot of interests, yet never really lost any of them. </p>
					<ul class="dropdown">
						<li><span><i class="fa fa-plus" id="Taek"></i></span>&nbsp; Taekwondo</li>
							<p  id="Taek">I used to practice Taekwondo between ages 6-10 and would have been a blue belt (fourth level). I proceeded with it at UF in my first semester. I sort of hated it in those days as it was taxing. Presently, I can offer anything to go back.</p>

						<li><span><i class="fa fa-plus" id="Cricket"></i></span>&nbsp; Cricket</li>
							<p id="Cricket">Everybody around me is a cricket fanatic and it was totally reasonable to skip meals the day your team loses. So the fact that I defeated everyone in my class when it came to naming cricket players is an accomplishment, okay? Still, have the magazines and daily paper articles from that period.</p>

						<li><span><i class="fa fa-plus" id="Football"></i></span>&nbsp; Football</li>
							<p id="Football">It changed in 2006 when football(soccer) developed as an enormous trend in my country. It now has a special segment in my life.</p>

						<li><span><i class="fa fa-plus" id="Dance"></i></span>&nbsp; Dance</li>
							<p id="Dance">I adored dancing and it fell into place without a hitch for me. I never knew there are people who think twice before dancing. Yes, I am fun at the parties! Being a plump child in the eighth grade, everybody ridiculed me when I was chosen for the yearly dance program of my school, since why not? The choreographer directing my dance proclaimed in the first week that I bested his 'Ought to Be Dropped' list. In the week prior to the program, he said 'I didn't know that you could dance so well'. Would've dabbed if it was in fashion then. </p>

						<li><span><i class="fa fa-plus" id="Languages"></i></span>&nbsp; Languages</li>
						<p  id="Languages">I began learning French as my 4th language in my 9th grade. I generally wrapped up the language textbooks before the school began! Cherish watching films and tuning in to music from different dialects. Presently, I am learning the Korean language.</p>

			<h4>The Football:</h4>
				<hr>
				<p>Since 2006, I support the English giants Manchester United and dream of watching them play at their home ground - Old Trafford, Manchester, UK. Football is one game that can possess my whole existence. As one of the greatest managers in the history of football, Bill Shankly, once famously said - "Some people think football is a matter of life and death. I don't like that attitude. I can assure them it is much more serious than that."</p>
