				<h4>The Web:</h4>
				<hr>
				<p> I could not draw since I was a child. Apart from a few mountains, the sun, a wavy river and a crooked house, I could hardly draw anything well. So after 2 years of drawing lessons and 6 years of biology diagrams(completed by my sister) it was evident and declared that I wasn't the creative one in my family and that I should stick to puzzles and math. I had multiple stints with creating websites since school but it wasn't until fairly recently that I discovered my love for it! I finally found what I absolutely love doing and looking back on my life everything just makes so much sense now. I started *studying* web development when I became the Webmaster for a student organization at UF and I realised that I have been creative all my life. I made up stories, invented new recipes, crafted simple household things, wrote fan-fictions, created wall decor for my dorm and more. I am in it for the long haul!

			<h4>The Football:</h4>
				<hr>
				<p>Since 2006, I support the English giants Manchester United and want to watch them play at their home ground - Old Trafford, Manchester, UK. Football is one sport that can occupy my entire being. As one of the greatest manager in the history of football, Bill Shankly, once famously said - "Some people think football is a matter of life and death. I don't like that attitude. I can assure them it is much more serious than that."
